At Genpact, I worked on Node.js backend services where most of the existing codebase was legacy and built using Express.js.

• Maintained and enhanced existing Node.js and Express.js APIs, making sure changes were stable and backward compatible.
• Worked on gradually modernizing the backend by introducing new microservices using NestJS alongside the existing Express-based services.
• Designed and developed new APIs using a modular structure, while keeping legacy services running without disruption.
• Helped decouple functionality from the monolithic setup into smaller, independent services as part of the modernization effort.
• Refactored APIs to improve performance, error handling, and overall reliability.
• Followed secure coding practices, added proper logging, and focused on writing clean, maintainable backend code.



Hi Nikitha,

Sharing the Node.js and legacy application/API-related points from my experience at Genpact below. 
I’ve kept them high-level and non-confidential, as discussed.

Please let me know if you’d like me to update and resend the CV with these points added.
